# Deno-runner

Simple Deno runner to make running larger projects easier. Built using Deno *(TypeScript)*.

**Features:**
  - Permission request before run
  - Watch mode *(-w / --watch)*

-----

## Permissions used by Deno-runner

  - **allow-read:** Required to read `deno_config.json`.
  - **allow-write:** Required to write `import_map.json`.
  - **allow-run:** Required to use `deno run`.

-----

## Installing / Running Deno-runner

Deno-runner runs best after being installed using Deno. Deno-runner can be run without installing, but will require you to either create an alias or your own execution script.

Due to how `deno install` works the deno-runner folder should not be moved after installation. If the `index.ts` file is not in the same place anymore you will get the following error: `Cannot resolve module "file:///home/<USER>/deno-runner/src/index.ts"`. This is simple enough to fix, either reinstall Deno-runner or create a symlink at the old location.

An installation script is provided but if you want to do it manually or change the name that it installs under use the following command:

```bash
deno install --allow-read --allow-write --allow-run -n deno-runner ./src/index.ts
```

If you want to run Deno-runner without installing you can use a simple run script. The script should use an absolute path to Deno-runner. `$@` is used to pass any provided arguments to Deno-runner. `$HOME` can also be used like in the example below:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
deno run --allow-read --allow-write --allow-run "$HOME/deno-runner/src/index.ts" "$@"
```

-----

## Updating Deno-runner

Due to how `deno install` works you shouldn't have to run the install script again, as long as the installation folder is the same. So if your current installation of Deno-runner is in `/home/<USER>/deno-runner` and the update is in `/home/<USER>/Downloads/deno-runner`, then you either need to reinstall Deno-runner or replace the old one with the new one.

-----

## Uninstalling Deno-runner

I haven't provided an uninstall script since this process would be slightly different for everyone and sadly Deno doesn't provide an uninstall option *(at least not yet)*. So please keep note of where Deno placed Deno-runner when it installed it.

Uninstalling Deno-runner is as simple as removing the file placed by `deno install`, for more information please check out [Deno's manual](https://deno.land/manual/tools/script_installer).

**Example deno install output:**
```
Compile file:///home/<USER>/deno-runner/src/index.ts
âœ… Successfully installed deno-runner
/home/<USER>/.deno/bin/deno-runner
```

-----

## Project setup

To run your Deno project using this Deno-runner simply add a config file named: `deno_config.json`

For more information on `deno_config.json` go to the [deno-config](https://github.com/mauritzn/deno-config) repo.

In the future I might add a `deno-runner init` command to make this process easier.

**Most basic config file:**
```json
{
  "main": "index.ts"
}
```

-----

## Config file

The Deno config file used by Deno-runner is a JSON file named `deno_config.json`, this structure of this file is laid out in the [deno-config](https://github.com/mauritzn/deno-config) repo.

Currently Deno-runner only uses 4 properties from the config file, `main`, `unstableFlag`, `permissions` and `imports`. In the future I plan to support more options.

**Example config file:**
```json
{
  "name": "simple_demo",
  "description": "Simple demo for config file",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "author": "John Doe",
  "main": "server.ts",
  "unstableFlag": false,
  "permissions": [
    "allow-net=github.com",
    "allow-read"
  ],
  "imports": {
    "fmt/": "https://deno.land/std@0.55.0/fmt/"
  }
}
```

### Imports

Currently using import maps in Deno is an unstable feature, which means your project will get the `unstableFlag` property if you use them. Due to the feature being unstable some editors language servers won't be able to handle the import properly, your project will run fine, but your editor might complain about syntax errors. To hopefully mitigate this somewhat Deno-runner currently writes `import_map.json` to the project folder, so that when editors update their language servers it should find the import maps and fix any syntax issues.

You may have to re-open your project in your editor for it to detect changes to `import_map.json`.


#### VS Code

In VS Code import maps can be used with out syntax errors using the following VS Code extension: https://github.com/denoland/vscode_deno. This also requires the use of a `tsconfig.json` file, to specify where the import map file is.

One thing to remember is that you need to run the project once using Deno-runner in-order for it to create the `import_map.json` file for you. Any update to the `"imports"` config option will also require that you run Deno-runner for the `import_map.json` file to get updated. This is because Deno-runner only updates the `import_map.json` file before running your project.

**Example tsconfig.json for VS Code**
```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "plugins": [
      {
        "name": "typescript-deno-plugin",
        "enable": true,
        "importmap": "import_map.json"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```
